### An Electron based tool for my home and it's many IoT devices.

---

Currently this app only does very basic and rudementary interactions with my Hue lighting devices.


### Things left to do

- [X] Get Electron up and going and toggling lights in the house from on and off states.

- [ ] Allow for color control and change within the application.

- [ ] Add some form of state check to update the buttons on page if there is a power state change to the lights.

- [ ] Allow usage from over the internet instead of on the local network itself.

- [ ] Work with Wyze system to allow for live time camera feeds within the application itself.

==A lot of this is new technology to me, so the code is going to be very very basic in the beginning until I get the hang of it and get a better idea of how to handle things==
